US County Level COVID-19 Forecasts

# Abstract:
The new daily counts of COVID-19 across the most populous 1250 U.S. counties is predicted using a modified compartmental epidemiological model, denoted NNMRA-SEIR. Modifications to traditional compartmental models include localized measures of nearby outbreak severity through a nearest neighbor heuristic. The ability of NNMRA-SEIR to predict COVID-19 cases is shown to outperform a baseline SEIR model on a multi week prediction task. Further, NNMRA-SEIR indicates a tighter fit around the true infection curve compared to a baseline SEIR model.
